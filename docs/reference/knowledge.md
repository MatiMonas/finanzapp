# Knowledge Base - FinanzApp

This document explains what FinanzApp does and how it helps users manage their finances in simple, non-technical terms.

## üéØ What is FinanzApp?

FinanzApp is a financial management application that helps you take control of your money by creating budgets, tracking your income, and managing your expenses. Think of it as a smart financial planner that works with your monthly salary to help you save money and spend wisely.

## üí° Core Concepts

### 1. **Budget Configurations** - Your Financial Plan

A budget configuration is like creating a personalized financial plan for your money. It's like having different "pots" where you decide how much of your salary goes to each category.

**Example**: You might create a budget called "My Monthly Plan" with categories like:

- 40% for Savings
- 30% for Food and Groceries
- 20% for Entertainment
- 10% for Transportation

### 2. **Budgets** - Your Spending Categories

Budgets are the different categories where you plan to spend your money. Each budget has a name and a percentage of your total income.

### 3. **Wages** - Your Income

Wages represent your monthly income. When you add your salary, the app automatically calculates how much money should go to each budget category based on your percentages.

**Example**: If you earn $3,000 per month:

- Savings: $1,200 (40%)
- Food: $900 (30%)
- Entertainment: $600 (20%)
- Transportation: $300 (10%)

### 4. **Monthly Wage Summary** - Your Financial Overview

This gives you a complete picture of your finances for each month, showing your total income and how much you have left to spend.
